Latest data compiled by Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) shows that the number of Districts under the grip of Maoist violence has dropped significantly since 2015, with over 90 per cent of attacks being reported from only four States — Bihar, Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand and Odisha. While 75 Districts across nine States reported violent attacks by Naxals in 2015, the number came down to 67 in 2016, and dropped to 58 in 2017, touted as the best year for the SFs engaged in anti-Maoist operations.CRPF, Director General (DG), Rajeev Rai Bhatnagar said, ""The past year, we have hit the Naxals in their den. Our coordination with state police, intelligence agencies and armed forces has been exceptional. The focus has been on leaders, over ground operatives and sympathisers. The Naxals are not able to move arms, funds and their senior leaders from one place to another."" He also said the influence of Naxals is now restricted to only three pockets — Bastar-Sukma (having an area of around 1200 square kilometres), AOB (Andhra-Odisha Border — 2,000 square kilometres) and Abujmaad forest area (4,500 square kilometres). ""There is a security vacuum and administration has not been able to completely access these areas,"" CRPF, DG, Bhatnagar said. In terms of operations, with over 150 cadres of CPI-Maoist killed, 2017 was one of the most successful years for the SFs. The anti-Naxal strategy was revamped after Union Home Minister (UHM), Rajnath Singh met Chief Ministers of Naxal-affected States in May 2017 following the killing of 25 CRPF personnel in Sukma District of Chhattisgarh. UHM, Singh has said that Naxal violence has come down by 60 per cent.In an internal policy document of Naxals — 'Action Plan 2017-2022' — recovered by intelligence agencies revealed that the Maoists themselves admited that 140 of their comrades, including 30 women, were killed by SFs in 2017."

We ensure that their families are not harassed. Simultaneously, we launch an offensive against these groups. They are continuously forced to be on the run,” he said."

A high-level meeting was held in Kozhikode on December 17, attended by Chief Secretary Tom Jose, State Police Chief Loknath Behera and other senior officers, considering the gravity of the strategy mooted by the Maoists. The meeting decided to immediately take necessary measures to prevent the Maoists from strengthening their influence among the locals.Kannur Range Inspector General (IG), Balram Kumar Upadhyay said: “The meeting decided to take up development work in backward areas in Wayanad district on a war-footing. The work will focus on schools, roads, hospitals and electricity.”Two days back, a five-member armed group of Maoists visited Thalapuzha in Wayanad demanding legal action against the persons responsible in connection with alleged suicide of Thavinjal Service Cooperative bank employee P M AnilKumar. The group also threatened with public execution of those involved if justice was not delivered.  The group also interacted with the public and pasted posters demanding action against former bank president P Vasu. According to a senior Police officer, the decision of Maoists to interfere in local issues is a matter of big concern for the State Government. “They are trying to play with the sentiments of the common man who always feel that justice is served only for the wealthy and powerful. If people start accepting the doctrines of the Maoists, situation is going to be really hard for the police as locals will start supporting them,” the officer said."

Extremism in Jharkhand is to be essentially understood and thought of in right context and not in any way outlandish one. Here its dimension is different,” said the DGP.

DGP said this arson was carried out by a group of Bihar led by Karu Yadav. Top Maoists’ leaders have pushed him in here to create disturbance. ""Jharkhand police will abort their nefarious and evil designs. Our police have also re-drawn its strategy to checkmate and fail and foil the plan of the Maoists. They will be contained and their sinister designs will be smashed” added the DGP.  He also said Maoists are making all out efforts to sneak in Jharkhand from Bihar and Odisha side of borders. ""Some have come here too but our men are after them. Days are not far off when they will be neutralised them completely. We need to further tune in our intelligence. It has to be smart and pin pointed. It will render the lives of the Maoists further miserable as our police are reaching out in those areas which some time back were a forbidden one. Our foot steps are everywhere.  Those outlaws too hear our sounds of boots,” said the DGP. “We seek people’s cooperation. We know Maoists base has eroded completely. They are not getting any big support from the people which they used to command in the past. I ask people to help police fighting these criminals with clinical precision,” he added."
