# Maoist-Insurgency
Project goal: Analyze news sources on maoist insurgencies in India on a village-based level to contribute to the SHRUG data platform. 

All info is gathered from this website: https://www.satp.org/terrorist-activity/

The website satp.org gathers news summaries of indian maoist insurgencies, and has been doing so since 2001. This website has the potential to be analyzed as their news summaries aren't split into any categories besides the news summary. This means I can use basic natural language processing to obtain the events that occured, where they occured, and much more. 
SHRUG (Socioeconomic High-resolution Rural-Urban Geographic Platform for India) is "a geographic platform that facilitates data sharing between researchers working on India. It is an open access repository currently comprising dozens of datasets covering Indiaâ€™s 500,000 villages and 8000 towns using a set of a common geographic identifiers that span 25 years."

By scraping the information from satp.org and sharing it with researchers at SHRUG, I hope to contribute what I can to the open data community, increasing the depth of knowledge available to everyone. 

This project is, as of March 19th, in progress: The news-analyzation is not as accurate as I would like it to be, so I am still working on it in my free time. I have included .csv files of what I have currently produced, as well as an excel file to see more easily the dataset I've created.
